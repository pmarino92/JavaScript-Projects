### Pizza Menu
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a variety of toppings. The user can input information, and the program will calculate the total price of the order.

### TicTacToe
A standard game of tic-tac-toe. Nothing more, nothing less. Sound effects are included when a winner is crowned as well as in the chance that the game ends in a tie!

### Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator. Styled with css, users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
